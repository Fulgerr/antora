    steps:
      # 1. Checkout your repository's code (the branch that triggers the workflow, e.g., main)
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Set up Node.js, as Antora is a Node.js application

          node-version: '18' # Using Node.js version 18. You can adjust if needed.

      # 3. Install Antora CLI and the default site generator globally
      - name: Install Antora CLI and Site Generator
        run: npm install -g @antora/cli @antora/site-generator-default

      # 4. Run Antora to build your site using your playbook
