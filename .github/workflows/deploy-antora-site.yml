    steps:
      # 1. Checkout your repository's code (the branch that triggers the workflow, e.g., main)
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Set up Node.js, as Antora is a Node.js application
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18' # Using Node.js version 18. You can adjust if needed.
          cache: 'npm' # Cache npm dependencies to speed up subsequent builds

      # 3. Install Antora CLI and the default site generator globally
      - name: Install Antora CLI and Site Generator
        run: npm install -g @antora/cli @antora/site-generator-default

      # 4. Run Antora to build your site using your playbook
      #    This assumes 'antora-playbook.yml' is in the root and outputs to './public'
      - name: Build Antora site
        run: antora antora-playbook.yml

      # 5. Deploy the contents of the './public' directory to the 'gh-pages' branch
